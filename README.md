# Robotics_Master
This repository contain the most remarquable project that I have worked on during my Master in Robotics at EPFL. This repository doesn't contain the most avanced AI project that I have worked on.
Note that this repository only contain PDF files and doesn't contain all the project.

## Implant

I'm Specialize In medical Robotics. I have work a lot on impanted device, Sensors and machine learning for Medical purposes.

* [**A Novel Approach To Aortic Restnosis**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Implant/A%20Novel%20Approach%20To%20Aortic%20Restenosis.pdf) : In this project we present a device whose goal is to address the need for early and precise detection of aortic restenosis
immediately following stenosis treatment surgery. 

* [**Smell Restoration**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Implant/Smell%20Restoration.pdf) We propose a device for Brain injury-induced anosmia
The device decode by Machile learning the odors sensed with gas sensors and stimulate the olfactory bulb accordingly. 

* [**Lab in Tube**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Implant/Lab_in_Tube_2019.pdf) Research design and Creation of flexible thin film sensor for temperature and flow rate measurements of blood in the vein. **The Project was presented during the 50 years event of EPFL** 

## Robotics Practicals

In Robotics Most of my courses was related to machine learning, system optimisation and mobile robotics.

* [**Application of Bayes filters**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Robotics_Practicals/Application%20of%20Bayes%20filters.pdf) : Use baysian filter (Monte Carlo) to solved the localization problem for mobile robots.
* [**Industrial SCARA Robot Adept**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Robotics_Practicals/Industrial%20SCARA%20Robot%20Adept.pdf) : Creating a small program that allows to play tic-tac-toe with a SCARA Robot
* [**Teaching Robots**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Robotics_Practicals/Teaching%20Robots%20to%20Acomplish%20a%20Manipulation%20Task.pdf) : Identification(PCA), Estimation location (computer vision), generate motion of pick and drop (GMR and Kalman Filters)
* [**Model Predictive Control**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Robotics_Practicals/Model_Predictive_Control.pdf) Develop an MPC controller to fly a quadcopter
* [**Swimming with Salamandra**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Robotics_Practicals/Swimming%20with%20Salamandra.pdf) Control a salamander-like robot based on oscillatory Neural Network (with Spikes)
* [**Neural Network Muscle Model**](https://github.com/stanFurrer/Robotics_Master/blob/main/Robotics_Practicals/Neural%20Network%20Muscle%20Model.pdf) Use Spikes Neural Network to model a muscle
